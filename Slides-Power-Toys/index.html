    <h4>Paranoia commands</h4>
    <p>Collection of commands to round various shape attributes to the closest decimal. A width of 1.23 inches becomes 1.2 inches. Select the elements to apply transformation to or select the slide to apply transformation to all elements.</p>
    
    <h4>Copy commands</h4>
